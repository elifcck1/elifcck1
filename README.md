# Hi there, I'm Elif! 👋

I am a passionate CS student currently focusing on building a strong foundation in software development. My goal is to bridge the gap between web technologies and data-driven solutions.

### 🔭 Currently Working On
- **Web Development:** Mastering **HTML5** and **CSS3** to build responsive and clean layouts.
- **Algorithms & Logic:** Strengthening my logic with **C**, **C++**, and **Java** through university projects and personal practice.

### 📊 Areas of Interest
- I have a growing interest in **Data Science** and **Data Management**. I'm eager to explore how data can be visualized and processed to solve real-world problems.

### 🛠 Tech Stack (So far...)
- **Languages:** C, C++, Java (Intermediate)
- **Web:** HTML5, CSS3 (Learning)

### 🎯 My Goal
I believe in "learning by doing." I'm currently documenting my journey by uploading my progress and projects here. My aim is to transition from small exercises to full-scale applications soon.
